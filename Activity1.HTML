                <h2>Facts about Parrots</h2>
                <p> Green parrots, such as the Senegal Parrot, Green-Cheeked Conure, Quaker Parrot, Amazon Parrot, and Military Macaw, 
                    are known for their vibrant green plumage and engaging personalities. These parrots are native to 
                    various regions, including Africa and South America, and are admired for their intelligence and 
                    ability to mimic sounds. Parrots, in general, are social creatures with strong beaks and unique 
                    feet, allowing them to grasp objects and eat with ease. They have a diverse diet that 
                    includes fruits, nuts, seeds, and sometimes insects, and their colorful feathers make them a 
                    favorite among bird enthusiasts.
